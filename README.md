This repository contains the code developed for the Sport Psychology project, which aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of various psychometric tools for
monitoring the stress-recovery balance in endurance athletes. The summary of the findings is provided in the uploaded PDF. The code is organized into three main files:
  1. FISI-analysis: The primary Python script for data analysis.
  2. GIMME-analysis: A Python script for preprocessing tables prior to running the GIMME model.
  3. GIMME_analysis.R: The R script used to execute the GIMME model on the preprocessed data.
